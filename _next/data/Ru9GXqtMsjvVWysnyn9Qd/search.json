Conduct research Our work is a result of more than a decade of applied research and collaboration with atrisk communities and human rights defense organizations around the world. Why this work matters People armed with smartphones are history's first responders, amassing rich, contextualized records of injustice and fostering unprecedented demand for change. However, most of these recordings presently reside on social media platforms that can chill free speech and are subject to censorship, privacy breaches, and data loss. While social media is an acceptable distribution platform, it does not provide sufficient privacy protections or archival preservation of this vital media. Our phones are replaceable but the moments we capture on them are not. Many activists, journalists, and eyewitnesses are storing precious pieces of history on the most fragile devices they own. The media itself is also ephemeral, as new threats to digital media arise. Who we are OpenArchive is a team of archival activists dedicated to protecting media freedom: preserving, amplifying, and securely routing mobile media to communitymaintained collections in accessible public and private archives, beyond the corporate walled gardens currently dominating the online media ecosystem.

OpenArchive is an experienced research, usability, and development team dedicated to protecting media freedom by helping eyewitnesses preserve truth to power. We’ve created a distributed media archiving ecosystem that enables human rights defenders to share, archive, verify, and encrypt their evidentiary media. We conduct coresearch, build tools, and create guides that advance human rights every day. Created by and for eyewitnesses and human rights defenders in 2015, OpenArchive fosters a more just, equitable, and sustainable media ecosystem where people's history is the primary history. What is Save? Save (Share, Archive, Verify, Encrypt) is a free, opensource, securemobile application built with and for eyewitnesses and human rights defenders. Save securely sends mobile media to the Internet Archive and other online and offline destinations using Orbot/Tor. OpenArchive unites the work of the Guardian Project, Creative Commons, Tor, and distributed secure servers. It offers atrisk groups more agency over their historical record by affording them secure transit, media authentication, pseudonymity, licensing controls, and the ability to choose where and how the media will be stored for longterm access and reuse. Save helps you store, share, and amplify your mobile media while ensuring your identity remains protected. It's also freely available for iOS and Android. With Save, you can add metadata and Creative Commons licensing to your audio or visual mobile media, then send it over TLS and the privacyfocused Tor network to the Internet Archive or other private archives to be saved. Save protects free speech by leveraging a suite of privacyenhancing technologies to safeguard your media and identity in the event of internet shutdowns, surveillance, device confiscations, content takedowns, limited bandwidth, and data loss. It also assures continued access to your saved media for years to come. What can Save do? Save is committed to usability and digital inclusion. Unlike other mediasharing tools, it offers responsive features that streamline secure preservation based on participatory research and codesign with communities we serve. With Save you can: Authenticate Media: With Save, you ensure your media is always authenticated because you have full control—without interference from intermediaries—from phone to archive. And, when paired with ProofMode (available now for Android, iOS coming soon), you can even add sensor data to corroborate the metadata captured alongside your media. Secure Transit: Save always uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) to ensure intransit security and encryption. When you enable Tor for mobile (either via Orbot: Tor for Android or Onion Browser for iOS), you add an additional layer of protection to ensure no one intercepts your media as it travels from your phone to the Internet Archive or your server of choice. LongTerm Preservation: When you use Save to archive your mobile media in a trusted archive (such as the Internet Archive or OwnCloud), you ensure unobstructed access for generations to come. This is in stark contrast to popular social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram, which aren’t committed to longterm media preservation. Licensing: With Save you can communicate your intentions for future use by easily generating a Creative Commons license inapp allowing others to reuse or modify your work. Stay Organized: Save's easytouse design allows teams and individuals to seamlessly streamline media from many phones into organized folders specific to each contributor. Add Metadata: Save lets you add metadata like location, people, and notes to your archived media. Flag Significant Content: You can flag certain media as “significant” to alert reviewers that this folder contains sensitive/violent media or just use it as a “favorites” folder. Import Media: Save allows you to import and share media from other apps on your phone, including audio, notes, and pdf files. Improve Redundancy: With Save you can further protect your media by creating and storing multiple copies on different secure servers. Whether hosting locally or remotely, your data can be encrypted on the backend and only accessible by who you want. View Progress: When storing media via Save, you can view how much content has been uploaded. Prioritize Uploads: prioritize particular media to upload first over others (e.g., order the smallest files first and largest files last). What can't Save do? Although Save offers a suite of many unique features, it’s no silver bullet. When using the app, please be aware of the following limitations: Save does not provide storage or server space: You will need to set up your own WebDavcompatible server (such as Nextcloud, etc.), or use the Internet Archive (free) or DropBox to create and store your collections. Save does not provide ondevice encryption: Save does not store your media; it only stores thumbnails from your camera roll, which are not currently encrypted in the app. Once organized into projects and uploaded to the server, all media is sent over an encrypted connection. We recommend that you also encrypt your server for enhanced security. Save does not delete original copies of media from your camera roll: Once media is sent to a server, you can then delete the thumbnails from the Save app if you choose. The original content will remain in your camera roll (unless you remove it). Save does not have an inapp killswitch: Uninstalling Save will remove all local copies of media/metadata stored in the app and all local configurations and settings, including account information. Is OpenArchive the Internet Archive? No, OpenArchive collaborates with the Internet Archive, but is an independent project. The Internet Archive is a nonprofit digital library offering free universal access to books, movies, and music, as well as almost a trillion archived web pages. OpenArchive is a project dedicated to the ethical collection and longterm preservation of mobile media. Save (share, archive, verify, encrypt) is the mobile application we’ve created to do this. Save enables people to send media to multiple places, including the Internet Archive and other destinations of their choice. This option also enables people to create public or private media collections. Why not social media? Although social media platforms are an easy place to house photos and videos, these platforms lack critical security safeguards and are subject to state censorship and content takedowns from the companies themselves. Use Save to avoid these pitfalls: Social media often exposes atrisk sources: Although major social media platforms can amplify content by exposing it to a large audience, these platforms can also expose sources to unwanted identification. Individuals shown or otherwise implicated in videos, photos, or audio clips may be targeted both online and offline. Social media can make it difficult to authenticate or verify media: Social media sites often strip metadata (info about where and how media was captured) from uploaded content. While this feature enhances privacy, the practice also makes media authentication and verification more difficult. Media gets lost on social media platforms: Within a sea of content, it is difficult to contextualize or organize media for easy access in the future. Social Media is not committed to longterm preservation: Companies moderate content, take down media, and go out of business. Who is Save for? We designed Save with and for individuals and organizations across the globe, including: Human rights organizations collecting evidence of abuse; Academic organizations accepting targeted or sensitive media from the field; Journalists and news organizations receiving sensitive media from vulnerable sources whose identity and personal details must be protected from interception; Archivists and librarians working to create community collections at the Internet Archive or other digital libraries; and Individuals, freelance documentarians, and citizen journalists/eyewitnesses interested in organizing and curating their own mobile media collections. Why use Save by OpenArchive? Save helps combat common threats, including: Loss of data: Both digital and analog data face ongoing threats, (e.g. theft, manipulation, surveillance, sabotage, or intentional destruction), loss (e.g. hard drive failure or misplaced USB stick), and incidental destruction (e.g. natural disaster, waterbased damage, or mold). Save helps protect against these threats by providing a way to create multiple backups of important data and distribute them across geographically and jurisdictionally diverse servers. Single point of failure: Keeping data in just one place increases the likelihood that any of the above scenarios may lead to an inability to use or access your data. With Save, you can connect and send media to multiple storage servers so that if one fails, the data will still be available elsewhere. Network surveillance and censorship: People often want to protect their content, identity, and/or activities from those who may be watching them (like governments, private companies, or untrustworthy individuals). Save hardens your network connection by always employing TLS (Transport Layer Security) and the Tor network via Orbot (for Android, iOS coming soon), which promotes privacy by encrypting data transfers and protecting against traffic analysis. Inauthentic or unverified content: Unverified content can lead to false conclusions and damage credibility. Save always uses SHA256 hashes and incorporates ProofMode (for Android, coming soon for iOS), a feature that supports robust verification and authentication practices. How can I support OpenArchive?

It seems every few minutes there is yet another news alert or push notification about Russia’s attack on Ukraine. Hundreds of thousands of troops are closing in on Ukraine, with explosions reported in Kyiv and other cities. The multipronged assault is an act of military aggression that hasn’t been seen in Europe in decades. Ukraine once again is pushed into the spotlight of imperial interests and debate.So how did we get here? The history is complex, and not easy to fit into a headline or Tweet, so navigating the news and updates surrounding Ukraine can be a challenge for those who aren’t already invested. We spoke to Eastern Europe editor for Global Voices Dr. Tanya Lokot on how to read the news around the conflict. Lokot, who is Ukrainian herself, has been a Global Voices contributor since 2013. Lokot’s research predominantly focuses on the role of digital media in postSoviet Europe. Here are some tools to help you look beyond the headlines: Navigating the news around Russia's attack on Ukraine Understand The Historical Context First Like any global conflict, the tension between Russia and Ukraine did not happen overnight. “Don't just think of it as a board game where things are moving every day on the chessboard,” Lokot said. “It's not really just about how many thousands of troops are at the border, but it's trying to understand well, where does this all come from?” Ukraine was part of  or occupied by, depending on who is telling the story – the Russian Empire and later the Soviet Union for centuries before regaining independence in 1991 following the collapse of the USSR. There have been tensions between Ukraine’s old ties with Russia and its allegiances with the West ever since. Timeline of Russia's attack on Ukraine In 2014, Ukrainians took to the streets and toppled proRussian president Viktor Yanukovych, demanding their independence and sovereignty. The Russian government meanwhile has consistently held the position that Ukraine is part of Russia. In 2014, Russian troops invaded Donbas and annexed Crimea, the biggest land grab in Europe since World War II. Today we see the escalation of war and the threat of further invasion of Ukraine.While Ukraine is the subject of the conversation, its people aren’t often centered in media reporting, which instead focuses on geopolitics between Russia and the U.S. and other Western European countries. “Ukraine is a country that has fought for recognition as a state for many, many years. And it's always been kind of smooshed in between these various imperial powers,” Lokot said. Lokot suggests people listen to more Ukrainian voices and sources when trying to understand the issue. “Understand why Ukrainians are so upset about somebody else trying to make decisions for them and why are they also upset when it's being framed as a conflict between Russia and NATO or Russia and the West? It's like, well, what about us?” For more historical context, Lokot suggests checking out the Ukrainian Research Institute at Harvard University, which has online resources and guides on the relationship between Russia and Ukraine. The Ukraine Forum at the Chatham House also offers helpful insight on the political dynamics of Ukraine. What To Consider When Reading U.S. and Other Foreign Media American journalists have been put into the awkward position of trying to explain the United States’ role in Ukraine while contending with the country’s dark past in getting involved in other global conflicts. “I think this colors both what U.S. officials say and how they say it and also how the U.S. media is reporting it,” Lokot said. In Afghanistan, the U.S. showed itself to be inept at combating corruption and insurgency. President Joe Biden’s perceived diplomatic failure in Afghanistan after pulling out the rest of the American troops now hovers over the media coverage in Ukraine as well. Western, particularly U.S. media, coverage of the conflict has been widely critical of President Vladimir Putin’s aggression toward Ukraine, but there have been a few blunders as they fall into Russia’s false flag campaign of “will they or won’t they” invade. The constant flow of unverified and misleading information has made reporting the truth difficult for journalists. The Russian government especially has a track record of using social media to spread misinformation. There are language and cultural barriers as well, Lokot said, citing the example of when Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy cracked a joke about the date of the invasion and Western media reported it as fact. Russian coverage of the aggression Meanwhile, the Russian state media tactics are aimed at popularizing the idea that Ukraine should be under Russia’s control anyway, and that Russia’s current aggression is just a pretext to circulate this idea, Lokot said. Even though Ukraine isn’t part of NATO, U.S. funding and support have played a significant role in Ukraine’s current form of government, but this same fact is used by Putin to discredit Ukraine as a true democracy, she added. Messaging on the Russian side of things has also been mixed. In the past few weeks, “they've been gleeful at U.S. predictions (of an invasion) not coming true, but also saying that Russia can indeed invade any day and possibly should,” she said. Now that Russia has declared Donetsk and Luhansk “independent regions” and has moved into Donbas, we’re seeing Putin’s flirtation with invasion becoming reality. Russia has now launched attacks on Ukraine on multiple fronts in multiple cities, including Kyiv. The broad offensive has already killed dozens. Pause Before You Share As tensions boil over and headlines scream about the invasion, it’s easy to retweet or reshare updates without always verifying where they come from, particularly if it's news that aligns with your current perception of events. It’s also important to pay attention to the language used in articles and posts. A lot of Ukranians have been critical about some of the language used in headlines and articles from Englishspeaking news outlets. For example, calling Russia's attack on Ukraine a “civil war,” or using the Russian spelling or Ukraine’s capital (Kiev) instead of the Ukrainian spelling (Kyiv). Lokot advises readers to take a pause and consider where the information is coming from, and whether the information stated is conjecture or fact. Ask yourself the following questions: “Even if the media outlet is reputable, are they citing any sources? What are those sources? If they're saying that there's evidence, is there any actual evidence? Is there a video? Is there a photo? Is there a map?” Question the Source There have been quite a few selfproclaimed “experts” on Ukraine who have come out of the woodwork over the past several weeks. Before you take their word for it, it’s worth doing a bit more digging. “If I see a name that's unfamiliar to me, who is trying to be an authority on something, at the very least, I go and see who this person is and what their affiliation is,” Lokot said. Still Stumped? Here Are Some Sources to Follow: Follow credible sources to navigate the news of Russia's aggression in Ukraine Ukrainian voices are often missing in news stories about their own country.

OpenArchive is partnering with the Iraqi Network for Social Media (INSMIraq), the first network of digital rights defenders and experts in Iraq, to bolster their archiving efforts and workflows. Established in 2011, INSMIraq is a nonprofit, nongovernmental civil society organization that advocates for a free, open, diverse, and safe internet. By cultivating networks between bloggers, journalists, activists, NGOs, and media organizations, INSMIraq pushes for an open internet free from restrictions set by governments or private corporations. OpenArchive’s partnership with INSMIraq will offer the Iraqi community new resources and tools to advance their mission. “We are so inspired by INSMIraq, who are doing incredibly important work to fight censorship, surveillance, targeting, and internet shutdowns to support civil society and internet freedom through human rights documentation and preservation work,” said Natalie Cadranel, Founder and Executive Director of OpenArchive. As Hayder Hamzoz, the Founder of INSMIraq noted, “...the Iraqi context is full of human rights violations, so eyewitness documentation is crucial for revealing the truth.” Digital and human rights threats and abuses are consistently observed and experienced in Iraq and the Kurdish Region of Iraq (KRI). Website filtering and blocking, content censorship, internet shutdowns, and threats to witnesses are all violations that have impacted Iraq, which INSMIraq and OpenArchive seek to address with digital rights tools and training workshops. In recent years, civilians in Iraq and the KRI have faced notable rights violations as authorities have targeted mobile media – censoring and destroying evidence collected during protests and disproportionately arresting witnesses that collected evidentiary photos and video footage – and silenced dissenting voices in the media and in public forums. “Human rights defenders and eyewitness documentarians need support to promote their work and protect their identities. Partnering with OpenArchive will produce outcomes that will help INSMIraq better understand our communities' needs, risks, and priorities. This will then provide our communities with the necessary tools and trainings to advance their important work of documenting, verifying, and preserving evidence of human rights abuses to advance justice and accountability,\" said Hamzoz. OpenArchive’s partnership with INSMIraq represents a commitment to preserving and amplifying Iraqis’ voices and creating a secure archive of accessible and verified media. Through this partnership, we will conduct a needs assessments, create user personas, hold workshops to learn more about realworld archival practices to help inform our community, and adapt our archival tools to the local Iraqi context. OpenArchive uses a human rights centered coresearch and design approach to work with communities worldwide to develop safer and easytouse mobile archiving tools and workflows. This methodology has been applied in recent research with OpenArchive’s partner, KHPG, in Ukraine and offers a critical foundation on which to further develop this research across regional contexts. Beyond this project with Iraq, OpenArchive is partnering with Decentralized Archivist Communities (DACs) worldwide to preserve evidence of war crimes, injustice, human rights abuses, and violence from extremists. OpenArchive has active partnerships with DACs in Ukraine, MENA, Latin America, and other communities across the world. OpenArchive supports its DACs with funding and by sharing technical expertise about best practices for creating and maintaining a secure archive. It also conducts ethnographic research to learn about the DACs’needs and pain points, and trains them on how to use Save to protect and simplify their archival workflows. OpenArchive first developed its Save (Share, Archive, Verify, Encrypt) app in 2014 to circumvent these obstacles. Save helps eyewitnesses preserve, protect, authenticate, and amplify crucial records of human rights abuses.

OpenArchive is partnering with the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group (KHPG) to support and enhance their impressive archival work. KHPG documents, preserves, and uses evidentiary media to hold Russia accountable for its war crimes and bring justice to the Ukrainian people. This partnership bolsters KHPG’s work by supporting a decentralized archivist community of journalists, historians, lawyers, and other ontheground eyewitnesses to facilitate trainings on best practices for archiving and digital security in active war zones. “Collaborating with KHPG to protect and preserve their crucial evidence is one of the most important and rewarding projects I’ve had the good fortune to work on,” said OpenArchive Founder & Executive Director Natalie Cadranel. “Their indestructible spirit, technological capabilities, and brilliant, dedicated team have shown incredible fortitude under extreme duress. Their commitment to exposing injustice and protecting human rights is truly inspirational.” Ukrainian authorities and international human rights groups are already investigating thousands of alleged war crimes since the start of Russia’s fullscale invasion in February 2022. These crimes include sexual violence, summary execution, looting, forced displacement, and countless other cases of abuse. Preserving evidence of these atrocities can aid in advancing the prosecution of these crimes and bringing closure to grieving families. “We must bring justice to the Ukrainian victims of Russian atrocities,” said KHPG Director Yevgeniy Zakharov. “It is crucial to document these horrific war crimes and ensure we preserve and verify this evidence effectively and securely. OpenArchive is playing a critical role to help us bolster this process. With their help, we are able to implement more streamlined ways to document war crimes with new technologies and create a more robust and secure archive. Our partnership is invaluable.” KHPG is one of the oldest and most active nongovernmental human rights organizations in Ukraine. The group documents human/civil rights abuses in Ukraine by recording interviews with victims and eyewitnesses of Russian war crimes and collecting evidence from open sources. KHPG also offers legal assistance to victims of the atrocities, bringing cases to the International Criminal Court and other international institutions. In March 2022, KHPG joined the Tribunal for Putin (T4P) global initiative alongside other human rights organizations to help collect opensource intelligence of Russian war crimes. 24 participating organizations specializing in specific regions verify and authenticate details from open sources while also gathering testimony from witnesses and victims. One of the members of the initiative, the Center for Civil Liberties, recently received the Nobel Peace prize 2022. “Behind each documented war crime, there is someone’s life that Russia ruined, traumatized, or claimed forever. Russia needs to be held accountable… We must help Ukrainians document Russia’s war crimes so that they will not repeat anywhere in the world,” said Viktoriia Savchuk, OpenArchive’s community manager for Ukraine. OpenArchive uses a human rights centered coresearch and design approach to work with communities worldwide to develop safer and usable mobile archiving tools and workflows. Beyond Ukraine, OpenArchive is partnering with Decentralized Archivist Communities (DACs) worldwide to preserve evidence of war crimes, injustice, police brutality, and violence from farright extremists. OpenArchive supports its DACs with funding, ethnographic research to learn about their needs and pain points, by sharing technical expertise about best practices for creating and maintaining a secure archive, and training them on how to use Save to protect and simplify their archival workflows. OpenArchive developed its Save (Share, Archive, Verify, Encrypt) app in 2015 to circumvent these obstacles. Save helps eyewitnesses preserve, protect, authenticate, and amplify crucial records of human rights abuses by routing their media to secure servers and public digital collections like the Internet Archive.

Since 2020, ALDEA has invested in building its organizational digital infrastructure to create more sustainable mechanisms for preserving documentation and multimedia content. OpenArchive’s partnerships with ALDEA will advance this project by helping integrate reliable workflow tools, develop compatible storage systems, and strengthen information management strategies. Cubalex is a Cuban NGO that defends and promotes human rights as a form of social transformation through legal aid and other resources. In recent years, the Cuban government has responded to dissent and public criticism with brutal repression and violence. Cubalex is one of the primary organizations documenting abuse against protesters and other human rights defenders. One of Cubalex’s top priorities is documentation and a significant volume of the organization’s resources are channeled towards safely maintaining evidence. OpenArchive’s partnership with Cubalex aims to expand the organization’s capacity to document and store evidence safely and securely. “The documentation and archiving of human rights violations have allowed Cubalex to raise awareness, sensitize the public, and reconstruct the historical memory in Cuba. The security and protection of information are part of the guarantees that victims need to exercise and enjoy their right to truth, justice, and reparation. We appreciate OpenArchive's opportunity to improve our archiving system and its contribution to ensuring that the horrors of the past and present in Cuba are not repeated in the future,” said Laritza Diversent, Executive Director of Cubalex. In the coming months, OpenArchive will be launching needs assessments with both the Ecuadorian and Cuban communities. The findings of these surveys will serve as the foundation for future coresearch, trainings, joint capacity building projects, and support within each region. OpenArchive uses a human rights centered coresearch and design approach to work with communities worldwide to develop safer and usable mobile archiving tools and workflows. OpenArchive mobilized this recent research alongside its partners – including KHPG in Ukraine, INSM in Iraq, and an organization in Sudan – which offers a critical foundation on which to further develop this research across regional contexts. Beyond these programs in Latin America, OpenArchive is partnering with Decentralized Archivist Communities (DACs) worldwide to preserve evidence of war crimes, injustice, and human rights abuses. OpenArchive has active partnerships with DACs in Ukraine, Sudan, Iraq, and the United States. OpenArchive supports its DACs with funding, trainings, and ethnographic research to learn about their needs and pain points, by sharing technical expertise about best practices for creating and maintaining a secure archive, and training them on how to use Save to protect and simplify their archival workflows. OpenArchive developed its Save (Share, Archive, Verify, Encrypt) app in 2015 to circumvent these obstacles. Save helps eyewitnesses preserve, protect, authenticate, and amplify crucial records of human rights abuses. OpenArchive lanza nuevas asociaciones en Latinoamérica y el Caribe con Cubalex y Fundación ALDEA OpenArchive se asocia con dos organizaciones de derechos humanos en Latinoamérica y el Caribe para fortalecer los esfuerzos y flujos de trabajo de archivos en la región. OpenArchive se asocia con dos organizaciones latinoamericanas, la Asociación Latinoamericana para el Desarrollo Alternativo (ALDEA) en Ecuador y Cubalex, una ONG cubana, para impulsar los esfuerzos de archivo comunitario y fortalecer sus flujos de trabajo más allá de los proyectos actuales en MENA y Ucrania. \"Después de trabajar principalmente en América del Norte, MENA y Europa Oriental durante la última década, estamos ansiosos por abordar finalmente la necesidad de una herramienta segura para verificar y preservar los medios probatorios que se han ido acumulando en América Latina y el Caribe. Cubalex y ALDEA están realizando un trabajo importante para proteger y defender los derechos humanos, y esperamos asociarnos con ellos para ayudarles a cumplir con sus misiones críticas\", dijo Natalie Cadranel, Fundadora y Directora Ejecutiva de OpenArchive. \"Es fundamental que quienes documentan evidencia de abuso de poder, injusticia social y violaciones a los derechos humanos en primera línea tengan acceso a las herramientas y el apoyo necesarios para llevar a cabo su trabajo de manera más efectiva y segura. La asociación de OpenArchive con Cubalex y ALDEA es un paso en la dirección correcta hacia la rendición de cuentas de quienes están en el poder, especialmente en América Latina y el Caribe, donde el autoritarismo siguen en aumento\", expresó David Aragort, Gerente del programa de Comunidad de Archivistas Descentralizados (CAD) de OpenArchive para América Latina. Fundación ALDEA es una organización ecuatoriana que tiene como objetivo diseñar estrategias colectivas con personas, comunidades y territorios para avanzar en el desarrollo de los derechos humanos, la equidad de género y la interculturalidad. Desde 2020, ALDEA ha invertido en la construcción de su infraestructura digital organizativa para crear mecanismos más sostenibles de preservación de documentación y contenidos multimedia. La asociación de OpenArchive con ALDEA impulsará este proyecto al ayudar a integrar herramientas de flujo de trabajo confiables, desarrollar sistemas de almacenamiento compatibles y fortalecer las estrategias de gestión de la información. Cubalex es una ONG cubana que defiende y promueve los derechos humanos como una forma de transformación social a través de la asistencia legal y otros recursos. En los últimos años, el gobierno cubano ha respondido a la disidencia y las críticas públicas con represión y violencia brutal. Cubalex es una de las principales organizaciones que documenta los abusos contra los manifestantes y otros defensores de derechos humanos. Una de las principales prioridades de Cubalex es la documentación, y un volumen significativo de los recursos de la organización se destina a mantener de manera segura la evidencia. La asociación de OpenArchive con Cubalex tiene como objetivo expandir la capacidad de la organización para documentar y almacenar evidencia de manera segura. “La documentación y archivo de violaciones de derechos humanos ha permitido a Cubalex visibilizar, sensibilizar y reconstruir la memoria histórica en Cuba. La seguridad y protección de la información es parte de las garantías que tienen las víctimas para ejercer y disfrutar su derecho a la verdad, la justicia y la reparación. Agradecemos a OpenArchive la oportunidad para mejorar nuestro sistema de archivo y su contribución para que los horrores del pasado y presente en Cuba no se repitan en el futuro” expresó Laritza Diversent, Directora Ejecutiva de Cubalex. En los próximos meses, OpenArchive lanzará evaluaciones de necesidades con las comunidades ecuatorianas y cubanas. Los hallazgos de estas encuestas servirán como base para futuras investigaciones conjuntas, capacitaciones, proyectos de fortalecimiento de capacidades y apoyo en cada región. OpenArchive utiliza un enfoque de investigación y diseño centrado en los derechos humanos para trabajar con comunidades de todo el mundo y desarrollar herramientas y flujos de trabajo de archivo móvil más seguros y sencillos de usar. OpenArchive ha impulsado esta reciente investigación junto con sus socios, incluyendo KHPG en Ucrania, INSM en Irak y una organización en Sudán, lo que ofrece una base crítica para desarrollar aún más esta investigación en contextos regionales. Además de estos programas en Latinoamérica y el Caribe, OpenArchive continúa asociándose con Comunidades de Archivistas Descentralizados (CAD) en todo el mundo para preservar pruebas de crímenes de guerra, injusticia y abusos contra los derechos humanos. OpenArchive tiene asociaciones activas con CAD en Ucrania, Sudán, Irak y Estados Unidos. OpenArchive apoya a sus CAD con financiamiento, capacitación e investigación etnográfica para conocer sus necesidades y desafíos, compartiendo experiencia técnica sobre las mejores prácticas para crear y mantener un archivo seguro, y capacitándolos sobre cómo utilizar Save para proteger y simplificar sus flujos de trabajo de archivo. OpenArchive desarrolló su aplicación Save (por sus siglas en inglés: compartir, archivar, verificar, encriptar) en 2015 para superar estos obstáculos. Save ayuda a los testigos a preservar, proteger, autenticar y amplificar registros cruciales de abusos contra los derechos humanos.","news/archiving-forward-part-2":"title: Archiving Forward Part 2  Mapping Our Decentralized Ecosystemdescription: How we build our organizational infrastructure for actiondate: 10/03/22category: Blogsimage: archivingforwardpart2.png Archiving Forward Part 2  Mapping Our Decentralized Ecosystem How we build our organizational infrastructure for action “Power to the people” is as much an organizational strategy as it is a rallying cry. From the postcoup resistance in Myanmar, to antifascist movements in North America and Europe, the age of the internet and digital literacy among the masses drives home a more radical form of people power. We know that anyone with a smartphone can expose global injustice, but the irreplaceable moments we capture on our phones are fragile and ephemeral. Oftentimes, the only other versions of this evidentiary media reside on social media platforms that — while extremely effective in amplifying social causes and primary accounts of injustice — can chill free speech through content takedowns, government censorship, and privacy breaches. Social media also does not provide sufficient privacy protections or archival preservation of this irreplaceable media. That’s why archival activists like ourselves are embracing more decentralized organizational models and technologies to ensure redundancy and accessibility. This second part of our threepart “Archiving Forward” series will talk about our decentralized ecosystem, and how community organizations, tech developers, and everyday civilians each play a critical role in preserving, amplifying, and securely routing significant records of social movements, state violence, and human rights atrocities. The tech industry's exploitation of its “users'\" content, data, and privacy signals the need for an accessible public trust, outside the corporate walled gardens currently dominating the online media ecosystem. Archiving Forward refers to a bottomup framework that brings autonomy back to the capturer. From the decentralized archivists who collect evidence of human rights atrocities to the collaborators and volunteers who build and contribute to our tools, to the stewards who amplify our work, we all have a hand in preserving truth to power. Decentralized Archivists We aren’t interested in creating a centralized archive at OpenArchive. Instead, we are cultivating decentralized, redundant, secure, robust, verifiable, and accessible archives that center the communities we work with. We use a human rights centered coresearch and design process to work with communities worldwide, which we refer to as Decentralized Archivist Communities (DACs). These DACs are made up of citizen journalists, legal observers, historians, and civilian eyewitnesses who capture and store critical evidence of war crimes, farright militia activities, police violence, and other human rights abuses. This evidence is often stored on the most fragile devices they own – their phones. There are countless tools and resources for the creation and capture of digital media. We are in a moment where we need to demystify the preservation of this content. That’s why we are training communities in Ukraine, Sudan, Iraq, Iran, Latin America, and the U.S. on how to use our tools and safeguard their mobile media. For example in Ukraine, we already have folks on the ground documenting Russian war crimes and creating robust, verifiable, and accessible archives to bring accountability and justice. We are partnering with the [Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group KHPG) to facilitate trainings on best practices for archiving and digital security in active war zones. In Philadelphia, PA, and Portland, OR, we are helping communities preserve evidence of social injustice, particularly violence from police and farright militias. OpenArchive and these DACs are implementing a robust, redundant, and interoperable archiving workflow. We are working with a number of communities that are already using our tools to create their own archives. Our goal is to engage more deeply with them by conducting collaborative research, educational outreach, and digital security trainings. Our Partners The role that individuals, small community organizations, and International NGOs play to create impactful archives cannot be overstated. We saw this in the Democratic Republic of Congo, when in 2018, two commanders of the rebel militia, Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda received life sentences for murder and torture after video evidence was used to expose their crimes against humanity. Efforts to collect, archive, and verify this crucial evidentiary media were the result of a close collaboration between both individuals and NGOs like TRIAL International, WITNESS, and eyeWitness to Atrocities. The scope of our work cannot be achieved without missionaligned partner organizations that share our goals to achieve a more just, equitable, and sustainable media ecosystem where the people's history is the primary history. Our collaboration with Guardian Project enabled us to launch our Save (Share, Archive, Verify, Encrypt) app. The partnership provided us with the technologists and usability expertise we needed to make Save an easytouse, secure archiving tool that empowers users to circumvent threats to free speech such as device confiscation, network blocking, doxxing, surveillance, and more. Secure, interoperable, and privacyminded tools are often inaccessible and unusable for small community organizations and everyday civilians. That’s where larger, wellresourced organizations or “stewards” come into play. Through our decentralized partnerships, we are leveraging our expertise and resources to demystify and adjust our tools and be more responsive to the communities they serve. Because Save is open source, others can adapt the app to fit their needs. Over the past decade, we’ve conducted coresearch with diverse communities worldwide to help us identify what critical features to add to our Save app. This research helped us to ensure the app is tailored to the communities who need it most. We intentionally developed Save as an open source application so that it can be modified by anyone to better adapt the features to their needs. Once we realized there was a need for Save within larger human rights NGOs, we partnered with Human Rights Watch to scope community needs, create personas, and adapt it for them, and ideally, other larger NGOs with similar needs. Save provides HRW with fully encrypted and selfhosted file transfer mapped to their archive for their international team. Partners like HRW act as our steward by using our tools and amplifying our guides and research with their communities, as well as sustaining the development of our work. Through collaboration, they help us adapt the tool and sustain our development work over time. Archival institutions like the Internet Archive provide free access to decades of digitized historical records. Our Save app utilizes the Internet Archive as an optional public backend in addition to connecting to private, secure, opensource servers so people have more control over who has access to their media collections. OpenArchive also unites the work of Creative Commons, Tor, and distributed secure servers like Nextcloud to offer atrisk groups more agency over their historical record by affording them secure transit, media authentication, pseudonymity, licensing controls, and the ability to choose where and how the media will be stored. Volunteers and InKind Support Volunteers and organizations that provide inkind support are invaluable to the OpenArchive ecosystem. Global programs and educational institutions like Internews’ BASICS program , Outreachy, and the UC Berkeley School of Information provide us paid contractors who specialize in programming, research, user experience, documentation, graphic design, data science, marketing, and user advocacy. Localization Lab fills a critical role to help us translate and localize our research, guides and technology to make it more accessible for a global user base. Our volunteerrun advisory board is also instrumental in supporting our organization’s fundraising, communications and programmatic strategy.

Now we take time to demystify the preservation process for this content. Our “Archiving Forward” blog series will explore and explain how different actors, from individuals, to community organizations, to technology providers, each play critical roles in preserving, amplifying, and securely sending significant and impactful mobile media to their destinations. Archiving Forward refers to a framework for bringing autonomy back to the capturer, through usercreated collections in an accessible public trust or private server, outside the corporate walled gardens currently dominating the online media ecosystem. When we began researching and prototyping our mobile application for ethical preservation (what is now Save) back in 2013, we discovered four key challenges facing organizations interested in managing mobile media: Few initiatives to collective mobile media; No easy way to preserve or license mobile media; Pressing privacy considerations; and A lack of resources. Looking back, it is astonishing how quickly technological innovation has been able to mitigate these key challenges. In particular, the advent of the cloud, and adjacent open source technologies and documentation, make the task of preservation much more affordable and accessible than it used to be. For the first entry in our Archiving Forward series, we will demystify the “cloud”: what it is, the benefits and drawbacks of using it to share and store media, and how we are utilizing it within the human rights community. We will also discuss why we chose Nextcloud as our preferred cloud backend. What is the cloud? A cloud is a type of server, so in order to understand the cloud, it ishelpful to be familiar with the term “server.” A server is a computer,or a computer program, that manages access to a centralized resource orservice in a network. A server’s function is to store, retrieve and sendcomputer files and data to other computers on a network  so the morecomputers and files you have that are regularly accessing a central body, themore important it becomes to ensure that these interactions are secure andeasily accessible. The following infographic via NSA's cloud security basics illustrates the various forms that the cloud can take: What are the main benefits of storing media in the cloud for the Human Rights Community? At OpenArchive our mission is to prioritize usability and privacy in our tools. Cloudbased storage considerably minimizes the cost of securely storing and sharing digital content, without requiring highly technical expertise and training. This way, public interest organizations, as well as individuals, can easily run, manage, and maintain a server. Additional benefits include: Improved privacy & security: some cloud services offer multiple layers of encryption and allow managers to set user controls, enabling them to choose who has access to the media on the cloud, as well as their level of access; More affordable than a local server: the cloud is relatively inexpensive over time; Easier to use: the UI (user interface) doesn’t require any coding knowledge and there is ample technical support available; and More accessible: all organizations need in order to access and manage the cloud is an internet connection. However, not all cloud services are equal when it comes to security and privacy, there are key privacy risks involved when using the cloud. While the cloud has benefits for organizations with less sensitive media, those housing media that can put people at risk of prosecution or violence if leaked, should consider only having offline, redundant servers. What are the key risks when using the cloud? The two primary risks people face when using the cloud are malicious adversary activity (i.e. hacking/data breaches) and unintentional configuration flaws. To reiterate, we strongly recommend those with highly sensitive media (i.e. whistleblowers, media organizations, legal advocates, etc.) use local, offline, physical servers. Data breaches: Large companies are more likely to be targeted by hackers; and Configuration flaws: Large companies with big servers handling multiple tasks are more susceptible to coding errors and other issues that are out of the control of the individuals or organizations that rely on them. Now that we’ve highlighted some benefits and risks of using the cloud, we recommend taking the following features into consideration when choosing a remote cloud storage solution. Why did we choose Nextcloud as a preferred private backend for Save? We chose to include Nextcloud as one of Save's backends because they offer selfhosting, prioritize encryption, are committed to usability, and have a consistent privacy policy. It is easy to use both remotely and locally, and is the most secure option, especially if people maintain their local own servers. Additionally, Nextcloud offers three layers of encryption on their servers making it less vulnerable to hackers than other cloud services. These are cornerstones of the Save project, which ensures media files are accessed, stored and shared securely. Do any other cloud backends work with Save Save not only integrates with open source cloud services like Nextcloud, but also features the ability to save media to both the Internet Archive and Dropbox backends, as well. By offering 3 different types of backends to use with Save, our goal is to support people’s varying storage needs. We will be including more as new options for secure, distributed storage emerge. In addition to Nextcloud, an open source cloud and physical server private backend, Save is also compatible with DropBox because it is more widelyused and accessible as many already have accounts (but offers less security), and the Internet Archive, a public backend committed to interoperability that guarantees your media is accessible online and in the future as formats evolve. While the cloud is no silver bullet, we believe Nextcloud is the best option for human rights defenders managing collections of sensitive mobile media who lack the capacity to host and maintain their own servers.","news/congress-privacy-bill":"title: What you need to know about the United States’ latest privacy billdescription: A federal privacy bill may give Americans more control over their data but does not go far enough and would weaken existing state protections.date: 09/08/22category: Blogsimage: usprivacybill.jpeg What you need to know about the United States’ latest privacy bill A federal privacy bill may give Americans more control over their data but does not go far enough and would weaken existing state protections. The U.S. Legislature is the closest it has ever been to passing a federal data privacy law with the recent draft of the bipartisan American Data Privacy and Protection Act (ADPPA). Americans are long overdue for a federal privacy law. While the ADPPA does contain some good policies – particularly for states that don’t already have strong online privacy regulation – the bill in its current form could weaken or even strip away existing privacy protections in states like California which have robust privacy laws. Here’s what you need to know: Who does the ADPPA regulate? The ADPPA broadly applies to organizations and companies operating in the United States, including corporations and nonprofits. The draft bill defines “covered entities'' as anyone who “collects, processes, or transfers covered data and is subject to the Federal Trade Commission Act.” This means big tech giants, like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, that mine sensitive information from millions of Americans would theoretically see unprecedented federal regulations. First, the good parts about the bill: It requires data collection to be as minimal as possible. It allows individuals to optout of “transfers of covered data,” limiting some forms of targeted marketing. It gives users the right to correct inaccuracies and potentially delete personal data collected by “covered entities.” It prevents some companies from using contract law to skirt the bill’s regulations. But the bill falls short on what is needed for robust privacy protections: It has a broad preemption provision, which means it would override, and in some cases, roll back, existing state and federal privacy protections, including California’s Consumer Privacy Protection Act. It doesn’t provide enough protections for individuals who want to sue companies that violate their privacy rights. It has loopholes that would treat some companies as “service providers,” giving them more leeway for collecting data. It still broadly allows targeted advertising, which is a major driver of most commercial surveillance. You can read more about the bill’s restrictions in EFF’s July 24, 2022 blog post about the bill. What people/organizations in our space are saying about the ADPPA “Federal privacy laws should not roll back state privacy protections. The ADPPA, as currently written, would override a broad swath of existing state laws and prevent states from future action on those areas, a structure called \"preemption.\" We have expressed disappointment and called on Congress to do better.”–Hayley Tsukayama, senior legislative activist at EFF “It seems like a good faith effort, but the details will be key. Basically every privacy expert and advocacy group is reading it right now.”–Evan Greer, director of Fight for the Future “A lot’s being said about the American Data Privacy and Protection Act. But not nearly enough on how it dismantles current privacy laws, including over 50 years of work in California. There’s a reason Big Tech supports it. And it’s not because they care about our rights.”–ACLU of Northern California What’s next for the ADPPA? Now that Congress is back from recess, the future of the ADPPA looks uncertain. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (DCalif.) announced on Thursday, Sept. 4, 2022 that she is concerned about the bill’s preemption provisions, saying it \"does not guarantee the same essential consumer protections as California’s existing privacy laws.\" Whether the bill has any hope of moving forward or is simply dead in the water depends on whether some sort of agreement will be reached that – at the very least – softens the preemption provision. You can read more about the political roadblocks ahead here in the International Association of Privacy Professionals' Sept. 6, 2022 Privacy Advisor post. What you can do The ADPPA still hasn’t reached the House floor so there is time to contact your representative and tell them that the bill doesn’t go far enough in protecting your online privacy. We deserve legislation that encourages more robust online privacy protections, not laws that weaken the protections that already exist.","news/digital-impact-podcast":"title: Digital Impact Interview with Nataliedescription: Founder, Natalie Cadranel, discusses how \"Save\" protects citizen eyewitnesses from online threats with Chris Delatorredate: 08/20/20category: Newsimage: digitalimpactinterviewwithNatalie.png Digital Impact Interview with Natalie Founder, Natalie Cadranel, discusses how \"Save\" protects citizen eyewitnesses from online threats with Chris Delatorre Save, a New OpenSource App, Empowers Citizen Reporters Hear Natalie Cadranel, Founder and Director of OpenArchive, in conversation with Chris Delatorre from Stanford's Digital Impact Hub about the why, what, where, who, and how of \"Save\".

Through this collaboration, we are receiving a grant from FFDW to expand our global partnerships with human rights defenders and join the growing movement to create and utilize a more ethical, decentralized internet. OpenArchive will now be able to support those who collect evidentiary media by expanding the capacity of our Save (Share, Archive, Verify, Encrypt) app to include decentralized backends. This will enable people on the ground capturing images and footage of crucial world events to leverage IPFS, Filecoin, and other decentralized storage options from their phones. Citizens armed with phones are history’s first responders, accelerating the push for worldwide social justice, using their smartphones as a tool to capture human rights violations around the world. However, many of these recordings are currently stored on vulnerable platforms that do not provide sufficient privacy protections or preservation of this vital media. When data is in the hands of a single company, it is susceptible to censorship, manipulation, or systemwide failure – putting the records of human history at risk. Decentralized technology offers a better alternative: it allows atrisk communities to own and control records to ensure transparency, accountability, and durability. Every day, witnesses and citizen reporters bravely capture breaking world events–and all too often human rights violations–on their phones. At OpenArchive, we work to enable them to securely share, verify, and preserve this crucial media to ultimately bring accountability and justice. We’re thrilled to work with FFDW to build the web we want by implementing and deploying decentralized technology to empower witnesses to protect and preserve truth to power. Natalie CadranelFounder and Executive Director of OpenArchive Save is a secure archiving app that helps people share, archive, verify, and and encrypt their mobile media. They can do so by securely uploading it, keeping it safe and organized for the longterm, and capturing crucial metadata to further authenticate it. With support from FFDW, we are enhancing our existing archival tools to support decentralized storage solutions through Save. This work will ensure that everyone will have longterm access to secure and resilient decentralized storage to protect and preserve humanity’s most important information. Additionally, as part of the grant, we will embark on a campaign to educate people and organizations around the world about the benefits of adopting decentralized storage protocols by equipping them with tools and educational resources. Our work will also focus on empowering atrisk communities to move away from the singlepointoffailure infrastructure that they rely on today. Our mission is to permanently preserve humanity’s most important information. We are proud to support OpenArchive’s work to preserve critical human rights data using the decentralized web.Marta BelcherBoard chair of the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web Learn more about FFDW grant programs here!","news/hello-mobilized-world":"title: Why OpenArchive?description: The web we wantdate: 05/13/18category: Blogsimage: WhyOpenArchive.png Why OpenArchive? The web we want Social media and other usergenerated content platforms  sometimes referred to as “web 2.0”  promised to empower individuals from around the world by providing new communication channels to bypass traditional media gatekeepers. Despite the egalitarian accolades heaped upon early content platforms startups, access to this new world of media has become unbalanced and asymmetrical. Contra Media Ecosystems of Control Social media and other usergenerated content platforms  sometimes referred to as “web 2.0”  promised to empower individuals from around the world by providing new communication channels to bypass traditional media gatekeepers. The ability for internet users to instantly upload content gave rise to an unprecedented look into political rallies, natural disasters, and military conflicts, but also daily life unfolding around the globe. People flocked to such platforms, so much so that, today, hundreds of hours of video content is added to social media platforms like YouTube each minute, while streaming services like Facebook Live have racked up over 2 billion viewers. Despite the egalitarian accolades heaped upon early content platforms startups, access to this new world of media has become unbalanced and asymmetrical. Over the past decade, this power has become centralized and entrenched. Motivated by profit maximization and an everexpanding quest for new markets, these corporate giants have made Faustian deals with governments around the world to keep their services streaming into some of the world’s most repressive regimes. As such, these great content repositories of the modern area have become tools of control rather than the onceheralded \"platforms of the people\". Digital artifacts uploaded to the major social platforms are regulated by both a country’s laws and companies’ own internal content guidelines; and while the amount of mobile media traversing these global platforms is stunning, little attention is paid to their respect for human rights or longevity of access to uploaded content. Delicate Memories Despite their popularity, the world can not count on global technology companies to have their users' backs. Activists and technologists must forge their own paths by building new technologies and leveraging grassroots communities. OpenArchive was born out of the need for a mobile tool that offers secure, longterm storage of photos, video, and audio captured on mobile devices. Our tool seeks to solve the issues related to keeping people and their media safe, sustaining legacy access to, and providing verifiable authenticity of content. In highrisk situations, this need becomes even more profound. Human rights defenders, citizen journalists, and frontline activists are being targeted on social media and do not have safe, alternative ways to manage and store their sensitive mobile media. In some cases, being digitally compromised can impact an individual’s freedom and wellbeing. Whose Media? Our Media! Before users learn the hard way that they cannot trust YouTube, Facebook, iCloud, Google Photos and other corporate platforms with valued and sensitive digital media, we provide an alternative secure archiving solution at scale. To further this goal, OpenArchive works with Guardian Project, who specialize in creating secure, open source technologies. Through this partnership, along with security usability experts, we will double our efforts to provide our global community with an easytouse, secure archiving application that empowers users to circumvent threats to freedom of expression such as device confiscation, network blocking, internet shutdowns, and more. OpenArchive is working towards secure, ethical, and usable solutions for you and your communities. We’re listening! In order to make the strongest product for our users, we want to hear from you.

The OpenArchive team is proud to announce the launch of Save, our new mobile application that integrates privacyenhancing technologies with digital media preservation to make media findable, verifiable, and archived for longterm access. Save enables individuals and organizations to streamline their management process for managing mobile media documentation, enhance their digital content collaboration, and make it easier to securely archive community and sensitive media. From social networks to video hostingplatforms, many of the goto media hosting platforms are monetized by invasive adtech, driven by surveillance features, and subjected to arbitrary content takedowns. We created Save to authenticate and safeguard media for longterm preservation and protect the identity of thosesharing their documentation. While researching and creating the tool with the communities it serves, we paid special attention to threats that we increasingly encounter when posting citizen journalism online, such as internet shutdowns, targeting journalists online, device confiscations,censorship, limited bandwidth, and data loss. While embarking on OpenArchive’s journey to launch our new flagship tool Save, we were deliberately careful to incorporate feedback from our extensive ethnographic research and incorporate emergent digital archiving practices. With a mission to provide an alternative hostingframework to commercially available products, Save puts control of the lifecycle of mobilemedia back in the hands of those who created the media: citizen journalists, human rights defenders, and others risking their freedom to share their stories. With native functionalities that include adding nuanced metadata for verification and Creative Commons licensing, Savewas built to streamline a user experience that is intuitive for both individuals and organizations. We couldn’t be where we are today without a wonderful community of supporters, many of whom have volunteered their time to help us design Save with our endusers’ safety, security and diverse circumstances in mind. We are also grateful to generous support from the Open Technology Fund and Knight Foundation who have helped OpenArchive continue to develop tools, integrate best practices, and improve usability over the past years. In the coming year, the OpenArchive team will continue to engage with our community, offer trainings, improve documentation, share our expertise, and advocate for open archiving frameworks that allow people to store and manage their content outside the walled gardens of proprietary Silicon Valley companies. Last month, OpenArchive’s founder Natalie joined panels and hosted a workshopto share Save with the Human Rights community at RightsCon in Tunis.

Free speech in Iraq is under severe threat, this time due to drafted digital content regulation that could criminalize investigative journalism and undermine free speech. This dangerous regulation is part of Iraq’s history of internet blocking/shutdowns, website filtering/blocking, censorship, and targeting of human rights defenders and eyewitnesses, all of which significantly impact the safety and work of those documenting and archiving injustices. OpenArchive and the Iraqi Network for Social Media (INSMIraq) – the first network of digital rights defenders and experts in Iraq – have launched the first phase of research to map the needs, risks, and threats of the Iraqi documenter community. In the Spring of 2023, OpenArchive and INSM jointly circulated a needs assessment survey that yielded insightful information about the challenges and realities shaping the experiences of those working within the Republic of Iraq and the Kurdish Region of Iraq (KRI). The survey was broadly circulated to INSMIraq’s networks and with over 80 responses, the research outputs represent the diversity of the community and offer OpenArchive a robust dataset to consider the best modes and mechanisms to develop and deliver support to these human rights defenders. Opportunities for Support Iraqi survey respondents identified three primary gaps in resources and capacities that shape their everyday workflow: a lack of technical resources and trainings (especially with respect to digital security and protecting sensitive data), outdated and insecure devices and technologies, and gaps in legal protections. Funding, resource allocation, delivering updated and secure technology, technical training (especially digital security training), and legislative advocacy – to reject the draft digital content regulation and advance protections for documenters – could all play a meaningful role in improving the working experience for Iraqi human rights defenders. “We learned from the 2019 Iraqi demonstrations that internet outages severely affected the documentation process. In response, we quickly adapted our technology and approach to collect evidence of human rights violations throughout the region during connectivity shutdowns. In continuing this effort to strengthen our documentation work, we are eager to identify and address the ongoing challenges of our community,” says Hayder Hamzoz, founder of INSMIraq. OpenArchive remains committed to supporting our Iraqi counterparts and facilitating trainings on best practices for archiving and digital security in precarious landscapes to help fill some of the existing gaps identified by those on the ground. Likewise, INSMIraq continues to host digital security workshops and discussions to tackle these issues. Additionally, nearly 30% of the survey respondents were already active Save users. Building on this, in the coming months, OpenArchive and INSM will hold trainings and workshops to receive feedback on the app and better understand how we can serve Iraqi documenters and archivists. Methods OpenArchive approached the survey analysis by grouping participants by role. This method is rooted in findings from previous needs assessments through which OpenArchive identified three key roles within communities: documenter (one who records and documents evidence firsthand), receiver (one who oversees and manages the reception, organization, and potential distribution of media/data), and dualrole (one who plays both a documenting and receiving role in their work). Threat Landscape for Iraqi Human Rights Defenders Survey respondents face a complex threat landscape comprising a variety of physical and digital risks. Many of the participants had experienced these risks firsthand. Those working primarily in receiver roles tended to face digital threats such as hacking, misinformation, malware, surveillance, and insecure digital storage. For those who work in documenter roles, these risks also included physical threats, physical attacks, arrest, torture, and facing the confiscation of their technology and devices. One respondent detailed a violent incident from the October 2019 demonstrations when they were “beaten and electrocuted…then, the most important thing, which was the memory card for the camera, was confiscated.” Another, also arrested during the 2019 October demonstrations, was “subjected to interrogation through the confiscation of my phone and the pictures in it from journalists.” Many respondents shared their personal experience with being hacked, censored, and surveilled. Connectivity Constraints The most prevalent frustration among documenters is inconsistent access to the internet. The documenters are evenly split in their preference for WiFi vs. mobile data, but many respondents note that their preferences are shaped by the circumstances (access to secure WiFi networks, size of data packages, etc.). Every documenter noted that they access the internet all or most of the time (58% all the time, 42% most of the time), and the majority have unlimited data plans to connect to mobile internet. The receivers are evenly split in their preference for WiFi vs. mobile data, but many receivers also remark that their preferences are shaped by the circumstances. Fifty percent of receivers have access to the internet all the time. Thirtysix percent of receivers have access to the internet most of the time. The remaining 14% noted that their access is only available some of the time or rarely. The majority of receivers have unlimited data plans to connect to mobile internet. Nearly all respondents in the dualrole category preferred to connect by mobile internet/data. Multiple respondents noted that relying on mobile data provides consistency across geographies locations, which in turn makes mobility easier. User Personas and Use Cases OpenArchive is now leveraging the findings from the survey to map INSMIraq’s needs and activities in order to build a more responsive framework. This is largely being conducted through user persona building and other research methods outlined in the humanrightscentereddesign (HRCD) methodology, that allows us to discover and gain deeper insight into the structural harms that INSMIraq and its partners experience. User personas are modeled after a particular individual or role, but also incorporate fictional aspects that researchers use to create archetypes that describe the behavior patterns, goals, skills, attitudes, and background information, as well as the environment in which the role operates. This HRCDfocused strategy is an intersectional, safe, and secure approach to developing a robust archetype that represents key characteristics relevant to the role.

The realities of working as a human rights documenter in an active war zone are complex and often unique to specific regions and contexts. Building on a year of partnership, the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group (KHPG) and OpenArchive have set out on a joint initiative to map some of these realities and create tools that can empower local activist and archivist communities to conduct their work as efficiently and safely as possible, while accounting for the particular challenges and characteristics of conflict zones in Ukraine. A recent needs assessment – designed, developed, and administered by KHPG and OpenArchive – offers an insightful glimpse into the realities, challenges, and opportunities that Ukrainian human rights defenders are facing in their efforts to document and expose war crimes and hold perpetrators to account. While a survey can of course never completely capture the range and depth of experiences, it has already proven a useful tool to map the risk landscape for the team in Ukraine – especially those concentrated in the cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Dnipro, and Khmelnytskyi – and consider the best modes and mechanisms to develop and deliver support to history’s first responders. Needs and Opportunities for Support KHPG survey respondents identified four gaps in resources and capacities that shape their everyday workflow: a lack of technical and financial resources (especially with respect to file storage systems), imperfect technical operations of database systems, incomplete information regarding attacks and hostilities, and poor communication due inconsistent technical capacities and capabilities among colleagues. Funding, resource allocation, technical training, digital tools, and communication platforms could all play a meaningful role in improving the working experience for KHPG staff. “In the very beginning of the Russian invasion, we managed to quickly build a dedicated database and then create a strong network of documenters. Now it's time to carefully analyze our workflow to see if we can make it more productive and safe,” says Denys Volokha, KHPG’s Media Director. OpenArchive remains committed to supporting our KHPG counterparts and facilitating trainings on best practices for archiving and digital security in active war zones to help fill some of the existing gaps identified by those on the ground. Overview of Findings & Risk Landscape for KHPG Team and Partners in Ukraine The sample of 24 individuals captured a broad range of roles within the community – including lawyers, documenters, database managers, and project managers – and a shared commitment to documenting war crimes and holding perpetrators to account. Nearly 92% of survey respondents are presently based in Ukraine and 54% of total respondents focus their work efforts on the Kharkiv region in particular, either remotely or locally. The region is located in northeast Ukraine and borders Russia, which makes it extremely vulnerable. From February to September 2022, almost half of the region’s territory was under Russian occupation. Sixtythree percent of all respondents work directly for KHPG while the remaining participants were affiliated with partner organizations. In 2022, several dozen nonprofit organizations joined their efforts in a global initiative “Tribunal for Putin” (“T4P” in short) to document war crimes committed by Russia in the territory of Ukraine in the joint database using KHPG’s methodology. All survey participants identified their primary goals as one, or both, of the following: documenting war crimes and/or offering legal assistance to prosecute those accountable for war crimes. The survey yielded key information on the framework of communication and connection within the archivist community. Seventynine percent of survey respondents receive multimedia evidence directly from eyewitnesses, most commonly via instant messaging applications (like WhatsApp and Signal), social media platforms, and custom databases. The majority of participants use OneDrive or Google Drive to store the received media, while a handful of respondents (22%) opt to save files directly on their computers. Colleagues, citizen journalists, media outlets, general public, and local NGOs, were other key sources within this network of media collection that respondents identified. The mechanisms through which the large volumes of media intake is achieved is primarily through mobile footage (80.3% of respondents), Telegram scraping (70.8% of respondents), YouTube (66.7% of respondents), Facebook scraping (62.5% of respondents), and documents (50% of respondents). Shelling, air raids, landmines, and violent arrests – perpetrated by Russia and its occupying forces – are a few of the physical risks that respondents named that shape their daily working realities within Ukraine. These physical threats in turn create a landscape of precarious infrastructure that contributes to digital risks. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has recently called on Russia to observe international humanitarian law, explicitly with regards to protecting critical civilian infrastructure, such as energy facilities and hydroelectric power stations. Recent missile attacks have already compromised energy sources throughout Ukraine posing severe risks to the population, and the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR) warns that future strikes could lead to further deterioration. Nearly 48% of the survey respondents identified power outages and internet disruptions as key threats that interrupt their connectivity and threaten their security and the security of their sources, colleagues, and work content. Respondents’ connectivity preferences and accessibility map onto these realities and tend to vary based on role, location, environment. Those respondents that capture evidence firsthand – in the form of mobile media, testimonials, and/or primary source research – often lack any internet connection on the ground. When connection is possible on the ground, these respondents expressed a strong preference to connect via mobile data and then once in a physically safe location, they typically prefer to use secure WiFi networks to upload and organize evidence. Those that organize, maintain, and use the firsthand evidence are often stationary and can safely connect to a consistent and secure internet connection via WiFi. Email attacks, censorship, hacking, digital surveillance and interception, and compromised confidentiality all influence the contours of the digital risk landscape in addition to the physical threats caused by wartime hostilities. While documenting abuses/incidents on the ground, 50% of respondents have experienced data loss, 25% have faced phone confiscation, 25% have struggled with internet connectivity, 12.5% have encountered malware or hacking, 8.3% have had their information compromised, and nearly 5% have experienced WiFi interception. User Personas and Use Cases OpenArchive is now leveraging the findings from the survey to map KHPG’s needs and activities in order to build a more responsive framework. This is largely being conducted through user persona building, a humanrightscentereddesign (HRCD) research method that allows us to discover and gain deeper insight into the structural harms that KHPG and its partners experience.

By Kelcie Grega and Alex Esenler, September 22nd, 2022 More than 18 months after the military coup in Myanmar that shattered hopes for democratic progress, Myanmar armed forces continue their violence against civilians with arrests, torture massacres, and sexual violence. Members of the country's resistance movement remain nimble as they navigate ways to document and preserve crucial evidentiary media of military atrocities in the face of internet shutdowns, brownouts, and imminent threats of arrest and violence. We talked to three anticoup activists who are working with folks on the ground trying to preserve truth to power. In this post, we'll share strategies the resistance is using to document and fight back against military violence, as well as keep the movement alive. But first, a history lesson The February 2021 coup d'état returned Myanmar to military rule under the socalled Tatmadaw, the armed forces of Myanmar. But the push and pull of military power and democratic government structure goes back more than 70 years. Sustaining a movement Myanmar’s postcoup resilience is built on decades of struggle against oppressors: from British imperialism to the current military power. While the country’s liberalization over the past decade systematically excluded ethnic and religious minority groups, protests and resistance efforts since the coup are much more inclusive. Global Voices reported in February 2021 that the General Strike Committee of All Nationalities (GSCN) united 27 of Myanmar's ethnic nationalities, displaying a show of unity against a common enemy. Duwa Lashi La, a lawyer, and politician who serves as the acting president of the National Unity Government (Myanmar’s government in exile composed of lawmakers and those elected in the 2020 elections) told The Diplomat in July that integrating Ethnic Resistance Organizations (EROs) has helped the prodemocracy resistance maintain territories in the Chin State, Sagaing, and Magwe regions. “Despite the challenges, I have never seen a more promising time for our people to find common ground and establish a genuine federal union together,” Duwa Lashi La, who himself is of Kachin descent, told The Diplomat. An independent researcher who studies digital activism in Myanmar, referred to here by the pseudonym Joseph, says what also sets this latest movement apart from past resistance efforts is that it’s being led by a much younger generation, armed with smartphones and a new sense of digital literacy. This new generation of resistance fighters already experienced life under a liberal democracy, meanwhile their older counterparts aren’t ready to go back to the way things were, he says. “They’ve already enjoyed a taste of freedom.” Staying safe while on the ground Ma Sabai – who asked to be referred to by this pseudonym – was in Yangon when the Spring Revolution erupted in early 2021. Her home was home just blocks away from daily protests and actions. Before the coup, Ma Sabai was already an active part of prodemocracy circles, educating her community on democratization, federalism and Myanmar’s constitutional process. When the military junta took over in Feb. 2021, she along with fellow resistance fighters took to the streets and documented both the protests and military violence on civilians. Young people in particular were targeted in mass arrests, torture and killings, according to Radio Free Asia. At sundown, Ma Sabai would bang pots and pans with her neighbors to protest the military power. “[The military] did not like that. They tried to hit us and shoot us with tear gas and they tried to arrest people,” she says. When security forces attempted to “disperse” the crowds, Ma Sabai said she would run to shelter. Some civilians who lived close to the action, including her brother, allowed protesters to take refuge in their homes. Once she and fellow resistance fighters found a safe place, they would hide all tools and pamphlets related to the revolution and quickly change their clothes so they couldn’t be recognized or tracked. Staying anonymous while supporting a cause In Myanmar, anyone who so much as “likes” prodemocracy and resistance content on social media can face up to 10 years in prison. Ma Sabai says she keeps multiple Facebook profiles with different names to keep her identity safe. She also never posts or interacts with resistance content on her personal social media accounts. When leaving the house, Ma Sabi says she deletes all social media apps and VPNs from her devices. Now, almost two years since protests erupted in Myanmar, the military is refocusing efforts toward cracking down on other forms of dissent like donating to revolutionary causes. A lawyer, who requested to remain anonymous as they advise ontheground activists in Myanmar on how to stay safe while documenting social unrest and human rights abuses, shared with us some strategies people use to mitigate risks. Average civilians who want to donate to or support organizations like the People’s Defense Force (PDF) – the revolutionary group fighting against the military junta – often have to take extra steps to protect themselves, according to the lawyer. One way is to label donations online with something innocuous. People donating from outside the country have to go through multiple layers of bank accounts to make it harder for the ruling regime to track transactions. Navigating digital security under state surveillance With the threat of military surveillance omnipresent, it becomes crucial to ensure those capturing military violence and coordinating, participating in, and documenting prodemocracy movements know how to keep themselves digitally secure. It’s vital to only share sensitive organizing information on endtoend messaging platforms like Signal and Telegram. “We also started giving ourselves aliases and different names, so that they will not be able to track us,” the lawyer says. For communication via email, the lawyer encouraged others to start using ProtonMail, which also provides security through endtoend encryption. Getting people to adopt more secure tools and messaging platforms hasn’t been easy, the lawyer says. For many people in Myanmar, Facebook is esentially the internet, and often acts as the primary organizing tool for civil disobedience campaigns, labor strikes, and other actions. After recognizing the power of smartphones in resistance efforts, the junta began implementing random checkpoints and searches on civilians’ phones. Both the lawyer and Ma Sabai say activists, eyewitnesses, and documentarians often keep multiple phones; one for personal use, and one for documenting protests and military violence. “If they find any content related to the revolution, you can be arrested and jailed,” the lawyer says. When Ma Sabai was documenting protests in 2021, she uploaded crucial evidence of military violence onto a cloud service before deleting it on her phone. Sometimes she would store files in a folder labeled with an inconspicuous name before military authorities had the chance to search her device. For the lawyer – who is currently based in the U.S. – encouraging digital security practices is a matter of life and death. “I have to really make sure that my family is safe back home because if you're outside of the country, they come after your family,” he says. Controlling the narrative The the anticoup resistance is fought both on the ground and online, with civilians controlling the narrative through hashtags like #WhatshappeninginMyanmar and publicly shaming military supporters online. While good for the revolution, social media is also used as a tool by the military to fight back against the resistance, Joseph says. When military leaders seized power, internet providers in Myanmar were ordered to ban Facebook (Meta)owned services in the country, including Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp. The demand for virtual private networks (VPNs) surged in the country, but the lawyer says the junta is currently seeking a ban on VPNs. Military authorities also use social media to disseminate junta propaganda. Radio Free Asia reported in March that military authorities often use Telegram to collect intelligence on prodemocracy celebrities, antijunta activists, and journalists. Activists told RFA that the military uses this information to crack down on antijunta actions across the country. In August, Tatmadaw spokesman MajorGeneral Zaw Min Tun announced that the regime plans to replace Facebook with its own homegrown social media platform. “It’s kind of scary,” Joseph says. “If they start doing that and contain [social media communications] there is no way to escape.” Keep up with #WhatsHappeningInMyanmar The situation in Myanmar is constantly changing and evolving.

OpenArchive, an organization dedicated to advancing freedom of digital expression, announced today the release of a new mobile application, Save, that safeguards digital evidence of human rights abuses around the world. As police violently crack down on peaceful protests, social media companies censor evidence of war crimes, national telecom services are suspended in times of unrest, and governments seek to suppress documentary evidence of atrocities, witnesses capturing media on mobile phones play a key role in exposing injustice during turbulent times around the world. Save makes it easy for journalists, activists, lawyers and others to safely store, share, preserve and amplify documentation of human rights injustices without fear of censorship, surveillance or retribution. Our Save app, which is open source and available for free through the iOS App Store and Google Play, fills the urgent need for an alternative to mainstream technologies, one that enables free and reliable sharing of evidence of human rights abuses and breaking news in ways that are easily accessed and managed. \"Organizations with distributed teams face challenges in aggregating, indexing and cataloging their communities' digitallycaptured content into particular workflows, often in and from dangerous locations\", says Natalie Cadranel, Founder and Director of OpenArchive and a fellow at the Stanford Digital Civil Society Lab. For Cadranel and organizations she works with such as Human Rights Watch, Save's success will be measured in what the tool can provide to human rights defenders; the app’s inception was a direct response to mounting efforts worldwide to suppress dissent through police crackdowns on peaceful protests, censorship by governments and social media companies, telecom service shutdowns, and other forms of retaliation. Unlike existing mediasharing tools, Save offers a suite of responsive features that streamline secure preservation based on community input, our commitment to digital inclusion, and iterative design. Key features include Ease of Use: userdriven, intuitive design based on community feedback throughout the toolbuilding process; Source Protection: TLS and Orbot/Tor for Android (iOS coming soon) prevent interception and surveillance; Media Verification: via hashing and Proofmode for Android (iOS coming soon), which adds sensor data to corroborate metadata captured with the media; Simplified Media Workflows: seamlessly organize media from many phones on your server into organized folders; Media Flagging: flag media as “significant” so reviewers are prepared for what they will see or as a way to \"favorite\" media; Batch Editing: update the metadata/flags of multiple media files at once; Importing from Other Apps: share media from other apps on your phone, such as audio/notes/pdfs. While those using Save can store their mobile media at the Internet Archive, they can also integrate the app into their existing serverside preservation architecture. This provides securityminded individuals and teams with a responsible, innovative “off the shelf” frontend solution for ethically collecting and curating their media from around the world. Whether hosted on individual servers or integrated with an organization's existing technical infrastructure, Save is engineered to create robust protection of and redundancy for mobilecaptured media content. Unlike most of today's major media platforms, Save values human rights over corporate profits. By streamlining media workflows to facilitate rapid response and reporting, it shifts power into the hands of those on the front lines. This means that the information sent through it cannot be censored, blocked or arbitrarily deleted. Our Save app, which is open source and available for free through the iOS App Store and Google Play, fills the urgent need for an alternative to mainstream technologies, one that enables free and reliable sharing of evidence of human rights abuses and breaking news in ways that are easily accessed and managed. The Save app fills a longstanding need to provide secure, fully encrypted and selfhosted file transfer for our staff all over the world,\" says Nicole Martin, Senior Manager of Archives and Digital Systems at Human Rights Watch. \"OpenArchive carefully listened to our needs, built an intuitive app, and tailored its features to make human rights data safer, and my job a whole lot easier. With support from public interest advocates, a team of open source developers, human rights archivists and ethnographers, digital security experts, journalists, and international civil society members incorporated extensive community input while creating Save.","partner":"Partner With Us NGO Partnerships Are you working at a human rightsNGO that needs a more streamlined and secure media intake and archiving process?

Anyone with Save can preserve truth to power.  About Save Save is an easytouse mobile app designed to help you store, share, and amplify your mobile media while protecting your identity. It's also free, opensource, and available for iOS and Android. Our smartphone media plays a critical role in exposing global injustice every day — however eyewitnesses and human rights defenders need better tools  to ensure the evidence they've captured is shared and stored securely. Enter Save. Designed with extensive community input, the app shifts power into the hands of those on the frontlines by streamlining media workflows to facilitate rapid response and reporting. With Save, you can now safely share, archive, verify, and encrypt your media without fear of censorship, surveillance, or retribution. Share Upload your verified media to your own secure server such as Nextcloud, Internet Archive, or DropBox. Communicate your intentions for future use by adding a Creative Commons license, allowing others to reuse or remix it. Archive Keep your media safe and organized for the longterm by saving multiple copies on noncommercial secure servers. Create inapp project folders that map to your personal or organizational media archive. Verify Authenticate and verify your media with sha256 hashes and optional ProofMode. Capture and include critical metadata like notes, people, and location with each upload. Encrypt Automatically upload over TLS (Transport Layer Security) to protect your media in transit. To further enhance security, install Orbot (a.k.a Tor for mobile) to prevent interception of your media while it travels from your phone to its destination. Who we serve We designed Save with and for human rights defenders worldwide, including: Human rights organizations collecting evidence of human rights violations Archivists and librarians creating community collections at the Internet Archive or other digital libraries Journalists and news organizations receiving sensitive information from vulnerable sources whose identity and information must be protected from interception Individuals, freelance documentarians, and citizen journalists curating their own mobile media collections Academic organizations accepting targeted media from the field Core features Unlike other mediasharing tools, Save offers a suite of responsive features that streamline secure preservation based on community input and our commitment to digital inclusion. Authenticate media With Save, you ensure your media is always authenticated because you have full control—without interference from intermediaries—from phone to archive. And, when paired with ProofMode (available now for Android, iOS coming soon), you can even add sensor data to corroborate the metadata captured alongside your media. Secure transit Save always uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) to ensure intransit security and encryption. When you enable Tor for mobile (either via Orbot: Tor for Android or Onion Browser for iOS), you add an additional layer of protection to ensure no one intercepts your media as it travels from your phone to the Internet Archive or your server of choice. Longterm Preservation When you use Save to archive your mobile media in a trusted archive (such as the Internet Archive or OwnCloud), you ensure unobstructed access for generations to come. This is in stark contrast to popular social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram, which aren’t committed to longterm media preservation. Licensing With Save you can communicate your intentions for future use by easily generating a Creative Commons license inapp allowing others to reuse or modify your work. Stay Organized Save's easytouse design allows teams and individuals to seamlessly streamline media from many phones into organized folders specific to each contributor. Additional features Add Metadata Save lets you add metadata like location, people, and notes to your archived media. Flag Significant Content You can flag certain media as “significant” to alert reviewers that this folder contains sensitive/violent media or just use it as a “favorites” folder. Import Media Save allows you to import and share media from other apps on your phone, including audio, notes, and pdf files. Improve Redundancy With Save you can further protect your media by creating and storing multiple copies on different secure servers. Whether hosting locally or remotely, your data can be encrypted on the backend and only accessible by who you want. View Progress When storing media via Save, you can view how much content has been uploaded. Prioritize Uploads Prioritize particular media to upload first over others (e.g., order smallest files first and largest files last).
